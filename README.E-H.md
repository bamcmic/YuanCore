## 🌌 Vision

YuanCore (元核) is not just an operating system — it is the beginning of an ecosystem.  
Our goal is to create:

- 🧠 **An OS for Developers**: Deeply integrated with development tools, designed for ultimate programming efficiency.  
- 🔒 **A Secure Computing Core**: Based on a microkernel architecture and an advanced permission model to ensure total security.  
- 🧩 **A Fully Original Kernel**: Written completely from scratch, independent of any existing systems.  
- 🌍 **An Open Innovation Platform**: Built upon open-source spirit, inviting contributors from around the world.
